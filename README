Voxel_Matching NORDIC (VM-NORDIC) README
% Alessandro Nigi, Jeroen Siero 2023
VM-NORDIC exploits the similarities between the time series of non-local 
voxels to construct highly homogenous low-rank patches, leading to a more effective denoising due to the higher signal redundancy.

The launching of VM-NORDIC is fairly similar to NIFTI_NORDIC.
Before lunching VM-NORDIC, the user should include the following four additional parameters:


1) ARG.voxel_matching = 1;              This option "switches on" VM-NORDIC

2) ARG.mask = 0 or 1.        With 1, the user has to provide a 3D binary brain mask nifti file as last input to NORDIC (fn_brainmask_in). 
                                        With 0, VMNORDIC uses an empty mask (1s)
   
3) ARG.speed_factor = val               val must be a positive integer larger than zero (suggested between 1 and 10). 
                                        This option allows to speed up the denoising without notable effects on the denoising quality. 

4) ARG.timepoints         = [n1:n2,n3:n4]; Specify timepoints (dynamics) to use for similarity estimation. Useful if you DO NOT want to base the similarity
                                           between voxels on their entire timecourse but on a specific period of time (i.e. active or resting period).
                                           If empty ( = []), all timepoints will be used
                                                
Example VM-NORDIC call: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



ARG.DIRIN              = '/Fridge/users/jeroen/FMRI/NORDIC/MM034_BOLD/';
ARG.DIROUT             = ARG.DIRIN;
fn_magn_in             = [ARG.DIRIN 'name_magnitude_file.nii.gz'];
fn_phase_in            = [ARG.DIRIN 'name_phase_file.nii.gz'];
fn_brainmask_in        = [ARG.DIRIN 'name_brainmask_file.nii.gz'];
fn_out                 = [ARG.DIROUT 'NORDIC_VM_'];
ARG.phase_filter_width = 10;
ARG.save_gfactor_map   = 1;
ARG.save_add_info      = 1;
ARG.gfactorcorr        = 1;
ARG.mask               = 1; % = 1 the user provides a 3D brain mask. = 0 no mask is provided and VM_NORDIC uses a empty  mask
ARG.speed_factor       = 5; % integer between 1 and 10. Speeds up the denoising
ARG.temporal_phase     = 1;

ARG.timepoints         = [1:20,50:74]; % selectionof specific timepoint to base similarity on for VM-NORDIC

ARG.voxel_matching     = 1; % = 1 activate VM_NORDIC
ARG.magnitude_only     = 1;
ARG.timepoints         = [];
ARG.make_complex_nii   = 1 - ARG.magnitude_only ; % change when ARG.magnitude_only is ALTERED
[MAGN,PHASE,GFACTOR,ARG] = NIFTI_NORDIC_VM(fn_magn_in,fn_phase_in,fn_out,ARG,fn_brainmask_in);


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There is no need to specify fn_brainmask_in if ARG.mask = 0;

The output image will be the denoised and masked input image.
